    * The auto-initialization process no longer sets column default

0.785 (12.31.2009) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * Fixed Rose::DB::Object::Cached to correctly honor alternate column
      accessor/mutator method names.  (Reported by Kevin McGrath)
    * Stopped the default auto-init handler from asking the convention
      manager to name foreign keys that have only partially populated
      column lists, causing it to burn through the "good" foreign key
      names.  (Patch by Douglas Wilson)
    * Corrected some typos in the ManyToMany documentation and the tutorial.
      (Thanks to Bart Dopheide)

      by tables with the same names in different schemas. (Patch by 
      Benjamin Hitz)
    * Removed the on-again, off-again restriction on aliasing primary 
      key columns.  I think it's off for good this time.

      more granular column method name customization.
    * Overhauled related object mutator methods to better match the
      documentation and reduce unnecessary queries.

      David Bourget)
    * Fixed an ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE test to work around a MySQL 
      "strict mode" quirk (or, IMO, "bug") which causes it to complain
      about a situation that is only a concern if it decided to do an
      INSERT rather than an UPDATE.  (Reported by Richard Jones)
    * Fixed a regression in t/spot-check-10.t: adding objects to 
      one-to-many-related lists failed in some circumstances.

    * Added support for multiple add_on_save calls prior to save(),
      which is how everyone expected it to behave anyway, and how the
      documentation always seemed to imply that it did work.  Well,
      now it does.
    * Pre-saved objects now get their foreign key columns hooked up
      correctly when passed as arguments to add_on_save methods.
      (Reported by George Hartzell)

      demand after an add_on_save and a subsequent save().

      update methods.  (Suggested by Kevin McGrath)
    * The update() method now marks updated objects as being in the
      database (see is_in_db() in Rose::DB::Object::Util)  (Suggested
      by Kevin McGrath)
    * The insert_or_update() and insert_or_update_on_duplicate_key()
      helper methods now call save() instead of insert() or update()
      (passing the appropriate flags to cause an insert or update) in
      order also save child objects.  (Suggested by Kevin McGrath)
    * The set_column_value_modified() function in Rose::DB::Object::Util
      now also clears any "db-ready" column value the object may be
      holding for that column.

      inlined in queries sent to SQLite.  (RT 37224)

      croak().  (Reported by Kevin McGrath)

    * Fixed a bug that caused "like" and other match operators to be
      provided with incorrectly formatted arguments when used with

      (Reported by Martin Rubli)

      with some caveats.

      have one or more BIT columns in a given table, you MUST call
      meta->allow_inline_column_values(1) when setting up the 
      Rose::DB::Object-derived class that fronts the table.
    * Added missing "use ..." statements to the code generated by
      perl_class_definition().

      list of columns to be selected.
    * It's now possible to filter based on columns that are not selected
      as part of a Manager query.
    * Extra parameters can now be passed to the method created by
      make_manager_method_from_sql()

      accidentally left commented-out in the last release.

    * Added pre_init_hook() method to metadata objects and the loader.
    * Added overflow attribute to control the behavior when a scalar, 
      character, or varchar column value is too long.  Possible values
      are "fatal" (the default), "truncate", and "warn".
    * Serial columns are now detected correctly even when DBI returns a 
      column type of integer or bigint.  (Reported by Cees Hek)
    * Added support for bigserial columns.
    * Enum columns now have their list of valid values printed correctly
      by the perl_hash_definition() method.  (Reported by Juan Camacho)      
    * Fixed a bug that caused the loader to trip over mixed-case unique 
      keys in MySQL databases. (Reported by Juan Camacho)
    * Force MDY dates in PostgreSQL in the test suite, just in case the user
      has European dates configured.  (Reported by Cees Hek)
    * Fixed numerous PostgreSQL 7.x bugs.  (Reported by Cees Hek)

      own private set of database rows in order to eliminate the influence
      of run order during the tests.
    * Worked around SQLite ORDER BY bugs in order to make the test suite
      function correctly.

0.59 (12.19.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

      for filtering on PostgreSQL array columns.
    * Fixed a bug that caused certain method overrides to fail when

      (Reported by Svilen Ivanov)

0.58 (12.16.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

      based columns.

      from databases with and without sequence support.  (Whew!)
    * Added a summary of the default conventions to the 
      Rose::DB::Object::ConventionManager documentation.

    * Added get_objects_from_sql() and make_manager_method_from_sql()
      Manager methods.
    * Made the use of prepare_cached() optional everywhere.  It's on
      by default in Rose::DB::Object, but off by default in Manager.
      Class data determines the defaults.
    * Added enum column type.

    * Added page and per_page manager parameters for the truly lazy.

      column prefixes in manager query parameters and sort_by
      arguments.
    * Changed manager and query builder to default unprefixed
      ambiguous columns to belong to the primary table ("t1").
    * Fixed a bug that caused make_methods() to fail for "... to one"

      when using the require_object parameter with "... to many"

      relationship type for foreign keys.

      for the convenient $obj = MyObject->new(id => 123)->load;
    * save() now returns the object itself on success, which allows
      for the convenient $obj = MyObject->new(id => 123)->save;

0.075 (09.19.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

      "with_objects" and "require_objects" parameters.
    * Corrected a bug that could cause missing sub-objects when
      using the Manager's "with_objects" and "require_objects" 
      parameters.
    * Added warning for doing multiple LEFT OUTER JOINs that could
      cause a geometric explosion of redundant rows.

      the warning described above.

0.074 (09.15.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * Repurposed the "with_objects" Manager parameter to do explicit
      LEFT OUTER JOINs instead of implicit inner joins.
    * Added "require_objects" Manager parameter to fill the old role of
      the "with_objects" parameter.

      SQL.  (Requested by Uwe Voelker.)
    * Removed restriction on aliasing primary key columns.

      instead of updated on save().  (Reported by Uwe Voelker.)
    * Corrected a misspelled method name in Rose::DB::Object::Cached.
      (Reported by David Glass)
    * Updated benchmark suite to include "one to many" search tests.

0.073 (09.09.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * Added deferred method creation for relationships and foreign
      keys in order to make "many to many" relationship setup more
      developer-friendly.
    * Renamed default auto-method type for foreign keys and relationships
      from "get" to "get_set", since technically these foreign objects
      can be set.  They just don't go into the database at that point.
      I'll probably use a different term for that process (e.g., "add")
    * Some POD and test fixes.

      definitions.
