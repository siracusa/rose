0.080 (11.01.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Added tutorial.
    * Added support for new argument types to relationship methods.
    * Added a named, configurable map for convention manager classes.
    * Added perl_manager_class() and make_manager_class() meta methods.

0.079 (10.25.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Fixed bugs that caused auto-inited many-to-many relationships
      to be inadequately fleshed-out under some circumstances.

0.078 (10.24.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Added page and per_page manager parameters for the truly lazy.
    * Fixed a bug caused by a conflict between the convention manager
      and the legacy foreign key name generator.

0.077 (10.20.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Added convention manager.
    * Added "distinct" and "fetch_only" manager parameters.
    * Added support for foreign key and relationship names as
      column prefixes in manager query parameters and sort_by
      arguments.
    * Changed manager and query builder to default unprefixed
      ambiguous columns to belong to the primary table ("t1").
    * Fixed a bug that caused make_methods() to fail for "... to one"
      relationships that have no corresponding foreign key.
    * Fixed a bug in QueryBuilder that prevented the ability to check
      for null columns.
    * Added the ability to query columns that are not SELECTed.

0.076 (10.05.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Fixed a bug that caused incorrect counts in get_objects_count()
      when using the require_object parameter with "... to many" 
      relationships.
    * Added bulk update and delete methods to Manager.
    * Added cascaded delete, plus a plea in the documentation for users
      to do this in the database instead.
    * Added "many to one" relationship and made it the new default
      relationship type for foreign keys.
    * Added *_now and *_on_save method types for foreign keys and
      "... to one" relationships.
    * Made get_set_on_save and delete_on_save the default auto method 
      types for foreign keys and "... to one" relationships.
    * load() now returns the object itself on success, which allows
      for the convenient $obj = MyObject->new(id => 123)->load;
    * save() now returns the object itself on success, which allows
      for the convenient $obj = MyObject->new(id => 123)->save;

0.075 (09.19.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Added support for "many to many" relationships to Manager's
      "with_objects" and "require_objects" parameters.
    * Corrected a bug that could cause missing sub-objects when
      using the Manager's "with_objects" and "require_objects" 
      parameters.
    * Added warning for doing multiple LEFT OUTER JOINs that could
      cause a geometric explosion of redundant rows.
    * Added the "multi_many_ok" parameter to Manager to suppress 
      the warning described above.
    * Forced inner joins when fetching foreign keys that have
      key columns that are all NOT NULL.
    * Added a few more sanity checks to class setup which, in turn,
      helped me to find and fix a few bugs in the test suite.

0.074 (09.15.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Repurposed the "with_objects" Manager parameter to do explicit
      LEFT OUTER JOINs instead of implicit inner joins.
    * Added "require_objects" Manager parameter to fill the old role of
      the "with_objects" parameter.
    * Documented new restrictions associated with the more sensible
      "with_objects" and "require_objects" parameters.
    * Added *_sql comparison operators to QueryBuilder, allowing inline
      SQL.  (Requested by Uwe Voelker.)
    * Removed restriction on aliasing primary key columns.
    * Fixed bug in Manager that caused fetched objects to be inserted 
      instead of updated on save().  (Reported by Uwe Voelker.)
    * Corrected a misspelled method name in Rose::DB::Object::Cached.
      (Reported by David Glass)
    * Updated benchmark suite to include "one to many" search tests.

0.073 (09.09.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Added deferred method creation for relationships and foreign
      keys in order to make "many to many" relationship setup more
      developer-friendly.
    * Renamed default auto-method type for foreign keys and relationships
      from "get" to "get_set", since technically these foreign objects
      can be set.  They just don't go into the database at that point.
      I'll probably use a different term for that process (e.g., "add")
    * Some POD and test fixes.

    * Added support for the "alias" parameter to hash-style column
      definitions.
    * Added "relationship" objects.
    * Fixed a bug that caused nearly everything to fail if a 
      column_name_to_method_name_mapper was used.
    * Moved some class methods out of the object methods section of the
      documentation, where they shouldn't have been in the first place.
