=head1 NAME

Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship::OneToOne - One to one table relationship metadata object.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship::OneToOne;

  $rel = Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship::OneToOne->new(...);
  $rel->make_methods(...);
  ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects of this class store and manipulate metadata for relationships in which a single row from one table refers to a single row in another table.

This class inherits from L<Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship>. Inherited methods that are not overridden will not be documented a second time here.  See the L<Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship> documentation for more information.

=head1 METHOD MAP

=over 4

=item C<get_set>

L<Rose::DB::Object::MakeMethods::Generic>, L<object_by_key|Rose::DB::Object::MakeMethods::Generic/object_by_key>, ...

=back

See the L<Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship|Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship/"MAKING METHODS"> documentation for an explanation of this method map.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=over 4

=item B<build_method_name_for_type TYPE>

Return a method name for the relationship method type TYPE.  Returns the relationship's L<name|Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship/name> for the method type "get_set", undef otherwise.

=item B<foreign_key [FK]>

Get or set the L<Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::ForeignKey> object to which this object delegates all responsibility.

One to one relationships encapsulate essentially the same information as foreign keys.  If a foreign key object is stored in this relationship object, then I<all compatible operations are passed through to the foreign key object.>  This includes making object method(s) and adding or modifying the local-to-foreign column map.  In other words, if a L<foreign_key|/foreign_key> is set, the relationship object simply acts as a proxy for the foreign key object.

=item B<map_column LOCAL [, FOREIGN]>

If passed a local column name LOCAL, return the corresponding column name in the foreign table.  If passed both a local column name LOCAL and a foreign column name FOREIGN, set the local/foreign mapping and return the foreign column name.

=item B<column_map [HASH | HASHREF]>

Get or set a reference to a hash that maps local column names to foreign column names.

=item B<type>

Returns "one to one".
