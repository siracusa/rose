=head1 NAME

Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship::OneToOne - One to one table relationship metadata object.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship::OneToOne;

  $rel = Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship::OneToOne->new(...);
  $rel->make_methods(...);
  ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects of this class store and manipulate metadata for relationships in which a single row from one table refers to a single row in another table.

This class inherits from L<Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship>. Inherited methods that are not overridden will not be documented a second time here.  See the L<Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship> documentation for more information.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item B<default_auto_method_types [TYPES]>

Get or set the default list of L<auto_method_types|Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship/auto_method_types>.  TYPES should be a list of relationship method types.  Returns the list of default relationship method types (in list context) or a reference to an array of the default relationship method types (in scalar context).  The default list contains "get_set_on_save" and "delete_on_save".

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=over 4

=item B<build_method_name_for_type TYPE>

Return a method name for the relationship method type TYPE.  

For the method types "get_set", "get_set_now", and "get_set_on_save", the relationship's L<name|Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship/name> is returned.

For the method types "delete_now" and "delete_on_save", the relationship's  L<name|Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::Relationship/name> prefixed with "delete_" is returned.

Otherwise, undef is returned.

=item B<foreign_key [FK]>

Get or set the L<Rose::DB::Object::Metadata::ForeignKey> object to which this object delegates all responsibility.

One to one relationships encapsulate essentially the same information as foreign keys.  If a foreign key object is stored in this relationship object, then I<all compatible operations are passed through to the foreign key object.>  This includes making object method(s) and adding or modifying the local-to-foreign column map.  In other words, if a L<foreign_key|/foreign_key> is set, the relationship object simply acts as a proxy for the foreign key object.

=item B<map_column LOCAL [, FOREIGN]>

If passed a local column name LOCAL, return the corresponding column name in the foreign table.  If passed both a local column name LOCAL and a foreign column name FOREIGN, set the local/foreign mapping and return the foreign column name.

=item B<column_map [HASH | HASHREF]>

Get or set a reference to a hash that maps local column names to foreign column names.

=item B<referential_integrity [BOOL]>

Get or set the boolean value that determines what happens when the columns in the L<column_map|/column_map> have L<defined|perlfunc/defined> values, but the object they point to is not found.  If true, a fatal error will occur.  If false, then the methods that service this relationship will simply return undef.  The default is true.

=item B<soft [BOOL]>

This method is the mirror image of the L<referential_integrity|/referential_integrity> method.   Passing a true is the same thing as setting L<referential_integrity|/referential_integrity> to false, and vice versa.  Similarly, the return value is the logical negation of L<referential_integrity|/referential_integrity>.

=item B<type>

Returns "one to one".
