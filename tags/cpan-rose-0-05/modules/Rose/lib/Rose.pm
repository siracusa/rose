=head1 NAME

Rose - A complete web application construction kit.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Rose;

    print "This is Rose version ", Rose->version, "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Rose is a work in progress, but it will eventually be a suite of modules
used to build web applications in the mod_perl environment.  Support for Apache
1 and 2 is planned.

The Rose suite is broken up into several components.  This module (Rose.pm)
lists all the other Rose components as prerequisites, including their minimum 
version numbers.  L<Bundle::Rose> is another way to install the entire
suite.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item B<version>

Returns the version number of the Rose suite.  This version number will not be
meaningful until I decide on a policy for suite versioning.  Until then,
ignore it and simply download the latest version of each C<Rose::*> component.
The easiest way to do this is to install L<Bundle::Rose>.

=head1 COMPONENTS

Rose is made up of the following components:

=over 4

=item L<Rose::Object>

A simple object base class and method maker.

=item L<Rose::URI>

A URI object built for easy and efficient manipulation.

=item L<Rose::DateTime>

Central location for all Rose-related L<DateTime> utility functions and
wrapper objects.

=item L<Rose::HTML::Objects>

Object representations of HTML tags, particularly HTML forms and fields.

=item L<Rose::DB>

DBI abstraction layer.

=item L<Rose::DB::Object>

Create and manipulate object representations of database rows.

=item L<Rose::Conf>

Perl module configuration system.

=item L<Rose::BuildConf>

Simple Perl build system for web applications.  (Unreleased)

=item L<Rose::WebApp>

Web application framework.  (Unreleased)

=back

As you can see, a lot of these components have not yet been released. I've
decided to release what I have so far because I think L<Rose::HTML::Objects>
may be useful immediately, even without any of the unreleased web application
code.

=head1 DEVELOPMENT POLICY

Here are the ground rules for the Rose suite:

=over 4

=item * B<All APIs are subject to change until version 1.0.>  I will try to
avoid breaking things unnecessarily before then, but I make no promises.

=item * B<If it is not documented, it doesn't exist.>  The Rose suite is
filled with classes that exist solely to factor out common functionality in
the public Rose modules.  Although these modules may look useful, I reserve
the right to change or eliminate them at any time in any version I<unless>
they have POD documentation.  If a module has no POD, do not try to use it.

Similarly, if a function or method is in a public module but is I<not>
documented in the POD for that module, don't just assume that I forgot to add
it.  Undocumented methods are undocumented for a reason, and are subject to
change or removal at any time, in any version.  If you feel like you need to
use the method, email me and I'll consider making it part of the public API.
